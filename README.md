# Review Analyser

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to analyze textual reviews using various text processing and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The focus of this project is to extract meaningful insights from review data, perform topic modeling, and visualize the results.

## Project Focus

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Text Processing and NLP**: Clean and preprocess the review text data using `nltk` and `textblob`.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of the reviews to understand the overall sentiment distribution.
3. **Topic Modeling**: Use `gensim` to identify and extract topics from the review data.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the results using `pyLDAvis`, `wordcloud`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to gain insights into the data.

Here is an updated README file that includes details about the project focus and what you do in this project:

4. **Visualization**: Visualize the results using `pyLDAvis`, `wordcloud`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to gain insights into the data.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `nltk`
- `textblob`
- `gensim`
- `pyLDAvis`
- `wordcloud`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install nltk textblob gensim pyLDAvis wordcloud seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Text Processing and NLP**: The notebook uses `nltk` and `textblob` for text processing and NLP tasks.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis on the reviews to understand the sentiment distribution.
3. **Topic Modeling**: `gensim` is used for topic modeling to identify key topics in the reviews.
4. **Visualization**: The notebook uses `pyLDAvis`, `wordcloud`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` for visualizing the results.
5. **Miscellaneous**: Regular expressions (`re`) and warnings management (`warnings`) are also used.
